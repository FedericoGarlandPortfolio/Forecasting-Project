The README file for this project is currently being completed. The objective of the project was to forecast vegetable prices, for which functions were created in R that iterate through several models (ARIMA, ETS, Holt-Winters and TBATS) and hyperparameters in the case of ARIMA (looping through p, d, q, P, D, Q) and selecting the best model to produce forecasts. The forecasting process was incorporated into the ETL of a Power BI dashboard to display the forecasts in an interactive platform for the end user.
